So, a long time ago, I made the idea for [pgpaste](https://github.com/jbmagination/pgpaste), which was essentially Pastebin with PGP.

There was only one problem: I had nothing to build off of. I had nothing to learn, because PGP is quite difficult to use. Most people only know that "hey, I can sign files and help others verify, I can encrypt files and help others decrypt, cool!"

But, most don't really know how to build it *into* something. How?

But, today, I've finally found what I was looking for. A PGP library that I could use. *[keybase/kbpgp](http://github.com/keybase/kbpgp)*. According to [their website](https://keybase.io/kbpgp), *kbpgp* is basically PGP that works for JavaScript. It also works in the browser.

This is a start. I'll keep you updated.
